# Spring_IOC


This repository contains a project that demonstrates the implementation of **Spring Inversion of Control (IoC)** principles. The code showcases how to manage dependencies in a Spring application, emphasizing loose coupling and enhancing modularity.


## Introduction

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle used to achieve loose coupling in software development. This project uses the **Spring Framework** to implement IoC through techniques such as **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Bean Management**.

The code demonstrates:
- How Spring manages object lifecycles using IoC.
- The different types of dependency injection (constructor-based, setter-based).
- Practical examples to showcase IoC in real-world applications.

## What This Code Does

In this repository, I:
1. Created a simple Java application to demonstrate **Dependency Injection** using the Spring Framework.
2. Defined beans and their dependencies in both **XML configuration** and **Java-based configuration**.
3. Showcased the lifecycle of beans, including initialization and destruction callbacks.
4. Illustrated how `ApplicationContext` and `BeanFactory` are used to manage beans.
5. Demonstrated real-world use cases for IoC, such as managing service and repository layers in an application.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used.
- **Spring Framework**: To implement IoC and DI.
- **Maven**: For project management and dependency handling.
